# EEScattering2D
This Julia package is used to numerically evaluate the linearized Boltzmann collision operator for electron-electron scattering in 2D materials. EEScattering2D also provides utilities for generating uniform and non-uniform meshes near the Fermi surface for general low-temperature calculations.
